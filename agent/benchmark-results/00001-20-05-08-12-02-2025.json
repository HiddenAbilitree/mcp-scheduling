      "answer": "First, let's identify the Pope and the war he ended. The article on Pope Paul II (born Pietro Barbo) states he was elected in 1464. The Thirteen Years' War article states the war ended in 1466. 1466 - 1464 = 2. So, the Pope born Pietro Barbo ended the Thirteen Years' War two years after his papacy began.\n\nNow, let's determine what famous conflict, immortalized in tapestry, took place 400 years earlier. The Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466. 1466 - 400 = 1066. The Battle of Hastings, which is immortalized in the Bayeux Tapestry, took place in 1066.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the **Battle of Hastings**.\n",

The prime numbers less than or equal to 17 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\n*   293 is not divisible by 2 (it's not even).\n*   293 is not divisible by 3 (2 + 9 + 3 = 14, which is not divisible by 3).\n*   293 is not divisible by 5 (it doesn't end in 0 or 5).\n*   293 is not divisible by 7 (293 / 7 = 41.857...).\n*   293 is not divisible by 11 (293 / 11 = 26.636...).\n*   293 is not divisible by 13 (293 / 13 = 22.538...).\n*   293 is not divisible by 17 (293 / 17 = 17.235...).\n\nSince 293 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, it is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is **yes**.\n",

The Olympic record for the 50m freestyle in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics is 21.07 seconds, held by Caeleb Dressel.\n\nFirst, convert the Black Marlin's speed to meters per second:\n129 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 35.83 m/s\n\nNext, calculate the speed of Caeleb Dressel in meters per second:\n50 m / 21.07 s = 2.37 m/s\n\nFinally, find the difference:\n35.83 m/s - 2.37 m/s = 33.46 m/s\n\n35.  83 - 2.37 = 33.46\n\nTherefore, the difference between the fastest recorded swimming speed of a fish and the Olympic record for the 50m freestyle in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics is **33.46 m/s**.\n",

The obverse of this coin featured Dwight D. Eisenhower. Also, the Kennedy half dollar was minted in 1972, so John F. Kennedy was also featured. The Washington Quarter was minted in 1972, so George Washington was featured on a coin. The Roosevelt dime was minted in 1972, so Franklin D. Roosevelt was featured on a coin. The Jefferson nickel was minted in 1972, so Thomas Jefferson was featured. The Lincoln cent was minted in 1972, so Abraham Lincoln was featured on a coin.\n\n2.  **Determine each president's length of service:**\n\n*   Dwight D. Eisenhower: January 20, 1953 – January 20, 1961 = 8 years\n*   John F. Kennedy: January 20, 1961 – November 22, 1963 = 2 years, 306 days\n*   George Washington: April 30, 1789 – March 4, 1797 = 7 years, 308 days\n*   Franklin D. Roosevelt: March 4, 1933 – April 12, 1945 = 12 years, 39 days\n*   Thomas Jefferson: March 4, 1801 – March 4, 1809 = 8 years\n*   Abraham Lincoln: March 4, 1861 – April 15, 1865 = 4 years, 42 days\n\n3.  **Compare lengths of service:**\nFranklin D.

      "answer": "Based on the provided Wikipedia articles:\n\n*   **John Muir:** Born April 21, 1838, and died December 24, 1914.\n*   **Ulysses S. Grant:** Born April 27, 1822, and died July 23, 1885.\n*   **Theodore Roosevelt:** Born October 27, 1858, and died January 6, 1919.\n\nThe \"Father of the National Parks\" is John Muir. The first president to declare a national park was Ulysses S. Grant, who signed the bill creating Yellowstone National Park in 1872. Theodore Roosevelt declared the most national parks.\n\nTo determine the period when all three were alive, we need to find the latest birth date and the earliest death date among them.\n\n*   Latest birth date: Theodore Roosevelt (October 27, 1858)\n*   Earliest death date: Ulysses S. Grant (July 23, 1885)\n\nThus, all three were alive from October 27, 1858, to July 23, 1885.\n\nTo calculate the time span:\n\n*   Years: 1885 - 1858 = 27 years\n*   We need to account for the portion of the year from October 27 to July 23\n\nFrom October 27, 1858, to October 27, 1884, is 26 years. From October 27, 1884, to July 23, 1885, is approximately 8 months and 26 days.\n\nSince the question asks \"for how long,\" a precise calculation is needed. The number of days from October 27, 1858, to July 23, 1885 can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of days from October 27, 1858, to October 27, 1884: 26 years = 26 * 365 + number of leap years. Leap years between 1858 and 1884 (inclusive) are 1860, 1864, 1868, 1872, 1876, 1880, 1884. That's 7 leap years.\nSo, 26 * 365 + 7 = 9490 + 7 = 9497 days.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of days from October 27, 1884, to July 23, 1885.\nDays in Oct (after 27th) = 31 - 27 = 4\nDays in Nov = 30\nDays in Dec = 31\nDays in Jan = 31\nDays in Feb = 28 (1885 is not a leap year)\nDays in Mar = 31\nDays in Apr = 30\nDays in May = 31\nDays in Jun = 30\nDays until July 23 = 23\nTotal days = 4 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 23 = 269\n\nSo, total days = 9497 + 269 = 9766 days.\nNumber of years = 9766 / 365.25 = 26.738 years\n26.  738 * 365.25 = 9765.795\n\nJuly 23, 1885 - October 27, 1858 = 9766 days\n9766 days / 365.25 days/year = 26.7380 years\n0.  7380 * 365.25 = 269.8\n\nTo convert 269 days to months, we can approximate: 269/30 = 8.9 months.\n\nTherefore, the three men were alive together for approximately 26 years, 8 months, and 26 days.\n\nHowever, the question asks for how long they were alive at the SAME TIME. Thus, we want the period from the latest birthdate (Theodore Roosevelt, October 27, 1858) to the earliest death date (Ulysses S Grant, July 23, 1885).\nThe time between Roosevelt's birth (October 27, 1858) and Grant's death (July 23, 1885) is:\n\nYears: 1885 - 1858 = 26 years\nMonths: July - October = -3 months (cross year)\nDays: 23 - 27 = -4 days\n\nSo calculating the days: From Oct 27 1858 to July 23 1885\n\nOct 27 to Dec 31 1858: 4 + 30 + 31 = 65 days\nJan 1 1859 to Dec 31 1884 = 26 years\nThere are 7 leap years => 26*365 + 7 = 9497 days\n\nJan 1 to July 23 1885 = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 23 = 204 days\n\nTotal days: 65 + 9497 + 204 = 9766 days.\n9766/365.25 = 26.73 years = 26 years, 8 months. 26.73 * 12  = 8.86 months. About 26 years 8 months and 26 days.\n\nRounding to the nearest year, they were all alive together for **26 years**.\n",

Therefore, we need to find the time when Muir and Roosevelt had already been born and Grant was still alive.\n*   Muir was born in 1838, and Roosevelt in 1858.

      "answer": "Okay, I will identify the Nobel laureates in Physics between 1901 and 1920 who contributed to quantum theory and their specific contributions. I will use the provided Wikipedia articles to verify the information.\n\nFirst, I need to list the Nobel laureates in Physics between 1901 and 1920. I will use the \"List of Nobel laureates in Physics\" Wikipedia article.\nThen, I will check each laureate to see if they made contributions to quantum theory, using their individual Wikipedia pages.\n\nHere's the list of Physics Nobel laureates from 1901 to 1920:\n\n*   1901: Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen\n*   1902: Hendrik Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman\n*   1903: Antoine Henri Becquerel, Pierre Curie and Marie Curie\n*   1904: Lord Rayleigh\n*   1905: Philipp Lenard\n*   1906: J.J. Thomson\n*   1907: Albert A. Michelson\n*   1908: Gabriel Lippmann\n*   1909: Guglielmo Marconi and Karl Ferdinand Braun\n*   1910: Johannes Diderik van der Waals\n*   1911: Wilhelm Wien\n*   1912: Gustaf Dalén\n*   1913: Heike Kamerlingh Onnes\n*   1914: Max von Laue\n*   1915: William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg\n*   1917: Charles Glover Barkla\n*   1918: Max Planck\n*   1919: Johannes Stark\n*   1920: Charles Édouard Guillaume\n\nNow, let's examine each of these laureates for their contributions to quantum theory.\n\n*   **Wilhelm Wien (1911):** According to his Wikipedia page, Wilhelm Wien won the Nobel Prize \"for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat\". His Wien's displacement law was important for understanding blackbody radiation, a key concept in the early development of quantum mechanics.\n*   **Max Planck (1918):** According to the Max Planck Wikipedia page, he is considered the father of quantum theory, and he won the Nobel Prize \"in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta\".\n*   **Johannes Stark (1919):** According to the Johannes Stark Wikipedia page, he won the Nobel Prize \"for his discovery of the Stark effect, i.e., the splitting of spectral lines by electric fields.\" This effect contributed to the developing understanding of atomic structure within quantum theory.\n\nTherefore, the Nobel laureates in Physics between 1901 and 1920 who made contributions to quantum theory are:\n\n*   **Wilhelm Wien (1911):** For his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat, particularly Wien's displacement law, which contributed to understanding blackbody radiation.\n*   **Max Planck (1918):** For his discovery of energy quanta, which is the foundation of quantum theory.\n*   **Johannes Stark (1919):** For his discovery of the Stark effect, which contributed to the understanding of atomic structure within quantum theory.\n",

    "scheduler": {
      "answer": "First, identify David Fincher's movies from the 90s with numbers in the title. According to the David Fincher Wikipedia page, these are \"Seven\" (1995) and \"The Game\" (1997). The later released movie is \"The Game\" released in 1997.\n\n\"The Game\" includes no numerical digits in the the title so the number to use in our calculation is 1.\n\nNext, determine the number of molars in an aardvark. According to the Aardvark Wikipedia page, \"The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars.\" So, the total number of molars is 14 + 12 = 26.\n\nThen, determine the number of adult teeth in a dog. According to the Puppy Teething Wikipedia page, \"puppies will eventually end up with 42 permanent teeth.\"\n\nNow, compute the ratio of the sum of all of the molars in an aardvark over the number of adult teeth in a dog: 26 / 42 = 0.6190476190476191\n\nFinally, multiply the later-released movie's number (1) by the ratio calculated above: 1 * 0.6190476190476191 = 0.6190476190476191 -> 0.6190476190476191\n\n**0.6190476190476191**\n",

According to the Wikipedia article, the prize was not awarded in 2012.\n2.  **Posthumous Publication:** In 2012, one of the finalists, *The Pale King,* was published posthumously.\n3.  **Author & Prior Novel:** The author of *The Pale King* is David Foster Wallace. He is best known for his 1996 novel, *Infinite Jest*. 2012 - 1996 = 16 years. The question states the novel was published 15 years prior, so *Infinite Jest* must be the novel the problem is referring to.\n4.  **Opening Lines & Band:** The opening lines of *Infinite Jest* inspired a song by a band. The Wikipedia article for *Infinite Jest* does not list any songs, but the Wikipedia article for David Foster Wallace states, \"The song 'Surrounded by Heads and Bodies', from the album A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships by The 1975, borrows its title from the opening line of Infinite Jest.\" Thus, the band is The 1975.\n5.  **Band Name Calculation:** We need to calculate the band's name using the provided formula:\n    *   Author's age on January 1 of the year *Infinite Jest* was published: David Foster Wallace was born on February 21, 1962. In 1996, on January 1, he was 33 years old (1996 - 1962 = 34, 34 - 1 = 33).\n    *   Add four: 33 + 4 = 37\n    *   Subtract the sum from the year the author was a Pulitzer Prize finalist: 2012 - 37 = 1975.\n6.  **Band Name Inspiration:** \"The band's name was inspired by a page of scribblings found in Healy's preowned copy of On the Road by Jack Kerouac which was dated '1 June, The 1975'.\" The band, The 1975, was thus named after a date found in Jack Kerouac's *On the Road*.\n\nTherefore, the name of the book and its author is **On the Road by Jack Kerouac**.\n",

Among the finalists that year, one novel was published posthumously. The author of this posthumous publication is best known for a different novel published 15 years prior. The opening lines of this book later inspired a song by a band. The name of this band can be determined with the following calculation: find the age of the author on January 1 of the year the latter book was published, add four, and subtract the sum from the year this author was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. The name of this band was inspired by yet another book. What is the name of this book and its author?",

      "answer": "Let's break down this complex trivia question step by step.\n\n1.  **Pulitzer Prize for Fiction with no award:** According to the Wikipedia article, the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction was not awarded in 2012.\n\n2.  **Posthumous finalist:** The finalists in 2012 were Karen Russell for \"Swamplandia!\", David Foster Wallace for \"The Pale King\" (posthumously), and Denis Johnson for \"Train Dreams.\" Therefore, the author is David Foster Wallace, and the posthumous novel is \"The Pale King.\"\n\n3.  **Book 15 years prior:** David Foster Wallace's most well-known novel published 15 years prior to \"The Pale King\" (2011) is \"Infinite Jest\" (1996). 2011 - 15 = 1996. Therefore, the book is \"Infinite Jest.\"\n\n4.  **Band name calculation:** David Foster Wallace was born on February 21, 1962.  In 1996, the year \"Infinite Jest\" was published, his age on January 1st would have been 33. 1996 - 1 = 1995 -> 1995 - 1962 = 33. Add four: 33 + 4 = 37. Subtract the sum from the year David Foster Wallace was a Pulitzer Prize finalist (2012): 2012 - 37 = 1975.

The 68th Academy Awards took place on March 25, 1996.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of years between the two dates: 1996 - 1953 = 43 years.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of days from January 31 to March 25.\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 31 to February 1 is 1 day.\nFebruary 1953 has 28 days (1953 is not divisible by 4).\nMarch has 31 days, so from March 1 to March 25 is 25 days.\n\nTotal days = 28 days in February + 25 days in March = 53 days.\n\nNow, calculate the age:\nAge = 43 years - 1 year = 42 years\nAge = 365 Days - 53 Days = 312 Days + 365 Days x 42 = 15,643 Days - 53 Days = 15,590 Days\nOr just 43 years and 53 days; in other words, Bella La Rosa had not yet had her birthday in 1996.\n\nSo, she was 43 years old.\n\nThe difference between January 31, 1953 and March 25, 1996 is 43 years, 1 month, and 23 days.\n1996 - 1953 = 43\nMarch - January = 2 months\n25 - 31 = -6 days\nSo, her age was 43 years, 1 month, -6 days = about 42 years old\n\nTherefore, Bella La Rosa was **43** years old on the day of the 68th Academy Awards.\n",

More precisely:\n1837 - 1830 = 7 years. June 20 is before June 26, so subtract one year. 7 - 1 = 6 years.\nDays in reign: (365-177) + 31+28+31+30+31+20 = 188 + 181 = 369 days. Since there are leap years subtract 2 days. So 369-2 = 367\nSo he ruled for 6 years and 361-365 days. 6 years and 359 is what it is.\n\nVictoria reigned from 20 June 1837 until 22 January 1901.
