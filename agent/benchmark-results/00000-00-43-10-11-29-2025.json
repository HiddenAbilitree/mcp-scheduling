Therefore, Bronte Tower is 823.8 feet tall.\n\nNext, I need to determine where a building of that height would rank among the tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024. According to the Wikipedia article \"List of tallest buildings in New York City\", as of October 2025 (when the article was last updated), a building 823.8 feet tall would be taller than The Orchard (823 ft) which is rank 38, and shorter than 56 Leonard Street (821 ft), which ranks 39. This means The Bronte Tower would rank between 38 and 39.\nThe Orchard has a completion date of 2026, which means it was not completed in August 2024, this will leave the position open for Bronte Tower. Since there are two buildings tied for 36th, each with a height of 847 ft, and The Orchard's 38th position has been removed, everything below the 36th position, inclusive, shifts up one.\n\nTherefore, Bronte Tower would rank **37th** among the tallest buildings in New York City as of August 2024.\n",

    "scheduler": {
      "answer": "Here's how we can break down the life cycle of the Ixodes scapularis tick to determine when it's most likely to transmit Lyme disease:\n\n1.  **Nymph Stage:** The question states the tick is in its nymph stage in the Spring. Nymphs are indeed active in the spring and summer.\n2.  **Becoming an Adult:** The question states the nymph becomes an adult in the same year. Ticks that become adults in the same year that they were nymphs are active in the Fall.\n3.  **Lyme Disease Transmission:** Both nymphs and adult ticks can transmit Lyme disease. The nymph stage is most likely to transmit Lyme disease due to its small size and therefore being harder to detect. The question specifies that the tick transmits Lyme disease as an adult.\n\nTherefore, if the tick feeds as a nymph in the Spring and becomes an adult in the same year, it will most likely transmit Lyme disease in the **Fall**.

Adding the 'give or take' of 18 miles, the range is:\n\n2721. 7 - 18 = 2703.7\n2721.7 + 18 = 2739.7\n\nSo the range is roughly 2704 to 2740 miles.\n\nNow, we need to determine which major European city is within that range of New York City.

It doesn't affect Usain Bolt or pool length. We need to determine how many times 1.95 meters (Usain Bolt's height) can fit into 50 meters (Olympic-size swimming pool length).\n\n50 meters / 1.95 meters = 25.641 -> 25\n\nTherefore, Usain Bolt can span the length of a standard Olympic-sized swimming pool **25** times.\n",

We must compare how many times Usain Bolt's height plus Tom Daley'd height sums to the length of the pool.\n\nPool length in meters / (Usain Bolt height + Tom Daley height) = number of spans.\n\n50 / (1.95 + 1.73) = 50 / 3.68 = 13.59\n\nTherefore, Usain Bolt could span the length of the pool 13 times while Tom Daley is standing on his head.\n\n**13**\n",

The Beatles' last album, Let It Be, was released on May 8, 1970.\n\nThe time between Oasis's first album on August 29, 1994, and 2024 is 2024 - 1994 = 30 years. 2024 - 1994 = 30\n\nThe time between Oasis's first album on August 29, 1994, and The Beatles' last album on May 8, 1970, is trickier to calculate directly. We can find the difference by subtracting the two intervals from a common date (2024):\n\nYears between Beatles last album and 2024: 2024 - 1970 = 54 years -> 54 years - (August 29 - May 8) to account for the days/months passed in the year. To calculate this: May is the 5th month, August is the 8th month. 8-5 = 3 months. Then, 29-8 = 21 days. So, we take 2 months off the 54 years (53 years and 10 months). Then, we add 9 days to that (53 years, 10 months, 9 days). We already know the difference in years between Oasis and 2024 is 30. So 30 < 53 years, 10 months, 9 days. This means the time between Oasis and 2024 is shorter.\n\nTherefore, the time between Oasis's first album and 2024 is **shorter**.\n",

      "answer": "Okay, let's analyze the clues and the provided context:\n\n*   **Clue 1: It had two official names in its history.** The Hoover Dam article mentions that bills passed by Congress during its construction referred to it as Hoover Dam, but the Roosevelt administration named it Boulder Dam. In 1947, Congress restored the name Hoover Dam. So, this clue fits.\n*   **Clue 2: Construction was ordered to begin by the husband of the President of The Girl Scouts of the USA in 1936.** The Hoover Dam article states construction began in 1931 and was dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on September 30, 1935. We need to find out who was the president of the Girl Scouts of the USA in 1936. The Girl Scouts of the USA article and the Lou Henry Hoover article indicate that Lou Henry Hoover was the president of the Girl Scouts of the USA from 1935-1937, and her husband was President Herbert Hoover. While the construction started in 1931, the husband of the president of the Girl Scouts in 1936 was Herbert Hoover. While he wasn't president during 1936 as Roosevelt was the president at the time, Hoover likely started its construction during his presidency.\n\nTherefore, the dam I'm thinking of is the **Hoover Dam**.\n",

To find out how many seasons aired by November 4, 2008, I need to find when each season aired.

According to the scraped data from the Wikipedia article \"List of animated television series by episode count\", the longest-running animated television series franchise in the United States is \"Looney Tunes\" with 30 seasons, but the longest-running animated television series is \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nNext, we need to find the number of full seasons of \"The Simpsons\" and \"X-Men: The Animated Series\" that existed when Barack Obama was elected president of the United States. According to the Barack Obama Wikipedia article, he was elected president on November 4, 2008.\n\nUsing the scraped data and the Wikipedia article for \"The Simpsons,\" the series had 37 seasons listed, with 38 seasons being listed on the Looney Tunes page. Per the Wikipedia article, when Obama was elected, \"The Simpsons\" was in its 20th season, which ran from September 28, 2008, to May 17, 2009. Thus, there were 19 completed seasons of \"The Simpsons\" when Obama was elected.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article for \"X-Men: The Animated Series,\" the series aired for five seasons from October 31, 1992, to September 20, 1997. Therefore, when Barack Obama was elected president in November 2008, all 5 seasons of \"X-Men: The Animated Series\" had already been completed.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of seasons of \"X-Men: The Animated Series\" from \"The Simpsons\" to find the difference:\n\n19 - 5 = 14\n\nTherefore, there were fourteen more full seasons of \"The Simpsons\" than seasons of \"X-Men: The Animated Series\" when Barack Obama was elected president of the United States.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{fourteen}$\n",

      "answer": "Let's break this down. We need to identify the \"Father of the National Parks\", the first president to declare a national park, and the president who declared the most national parks. Then we need to determine the period when all three were alive concurrently.\n\nBased on the provided articles:\n*   John Muir is considered the \"Father of the National Parks\".\n*   Ulysses S. Grant was the first president to declare a national park (Yellowstone in 1872).\n*   Theodore Roosevelt declared the most national parks.\n\nNow, let's find their birth and death dates to calculate the overlapping period.\n\nJohn Muir: Born April 21, 1838, Died December 24, 1914.\nUlysses S. Grant: Born April 27, 1822, Died July 23, 1885.\nTheodore Roosevelt: Born October 27, 1858, Died January 6, 1919.\n\nWe need to find the time span when all three were alive.\n\nUlysses S. Grant died in 1885. Therefore, the overlapping period ends in 1885.\nTheodore Roosevelt was born in 1858. Therefore, the overlapping period starts in 1858.\n\nSo, the overlapping period is from 1858 to 1885.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of years: 1885 - 1858 = 27 years. Note that we don't need to add 1 since we are calculating the number of years both presidents were alive at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the three figures were all alive at the same time for **27 years**.\n",

Grant** (First president to declare a national park): Born April 27, 1822, and died July 23, 1885.\n*   **Theodore Roosevelt** (President who declared the most national parks): Born October 27, 1858, and died January 6, 1919.\n\nNow let's determine the period when all three were alive:\n\n1.  **Grant's lifespan:** April 27, 1822 - July 23, 1885\n2.  **Muir's lifespan:** April 21, 1838 - December 24, 1914\n3.  **Roosevelt's lifespan:** October 27, 1858 - January 6, 1919\n\nThe time they were all alive is determined by the latest birth date and the earliest death date.\n\n*   Latest birth date: October 27, 1858 (Roosevelt)\n*   Earliest death date: July 23, 1885 (Grant)\n\nThus, they were all alive from October 27, 1858, to July 23, 1885. Now, let's calculate the duration:\n\n*Years:* 1885 - 1858 = 27 years\n*Months:* July - October = -3 months. Since the months are negative, we should subtract a year from 27 to get 26 years. Then add 12 months to -3 months to get 9 months: July of 1885 is 9 months after October of 1884.\n*Days:* Then let's get the days: 23-27=-4. July 23 is 4 days before October 27. This means we should subtract a month and add approximately 30 days to -4. 9 months -1 month = 8 months. 30 days - 4 days = 26 days.\n\nSo, their lifespans overlapped for 26 years, 8 months, and 26 days.\n\nHowever, to simplify, we can calculate the number of full years.\nThey all lived from October 27, 1858, to July 23, 1885.\nTherefore, the number of full years is 1885 - 1859 = 26 years.\nOctober 27, 1858 to October 27, 1884, is 26 years.\nSince July 23, 1885 is before October 27, 1885, the answer is 26 full years.\n\nTherefore, the \"Father of the National Parks\", the first president to declare a national park, and the president who declared the most national parks were all alive at the same time for **26 years**.\n",

    "question": "Since the turn of the 21st century, there has only been one year in which the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction has not been awarded. Among the finalists that year, one novel was published posthumously. The author of this posthumous publication is best known for a different novel published 15 years prior. The opening lines of this book later inspired a song by a band. The name of this band can be determined with the following calculation: find the age of the author on January 1 of the year the latter book was published, add four, and subtract the sum from the year this author was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. The name of this band was inspired by yet another book. What is the name of this book and its author?",
    "scheduler": {
      "answer": "First, let's identify the year in the 21st century when the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction was not awarded. According to the Wikipedia article \"Pulitzer Prize for Fiction,\" this occurred in 2012. Among the finalists that year, one novel was published posthumously.\n\nNext, we need to find the author of that posthumous publication. According to the Wikipedia article, the posthumously published novel was \"The Pale King\" by David Foster Wallace. Wallace is best known for his novel \"Infinite Jest.\"\n\nNow we need to verify that Infinite Jest was published 15 years prior. Infinite Jest was published in 1996. 2012 - 1996 = 16. This is incorrect. I need to check the publication year of The Pale King. The Pale King was published in 2011. 2011 - 1996 = 15. Therefore, Infinite Jest was published 15 years prior to The Pale King.\n\nThe opening lines of \"Infinite Jest\" inspired a song. Let's check the Wikipedia article for adaptations. The Wikipedia article \"Infinite Jest\" mentions adaptations, including a song.\n\nNow, we need to determine the name of the band. David Foster Wallace was born on February 21, 1962. On January 1, 1996, he was 33 years old. 1996 - 1962 = 34. Subtract 1 since the date is January 1. Thus, corrected age = 33. Add four to his age: 33 + 4 = 37. Subtract the sum from the year Wallace was a Pulitzer Prize finalist (2012): 2012 - 37 = 1975.\n\nThe band's name is The 1975. The Wikipedia page for The 1975 states that the band's name was inspired by scribblings found on the back page of Jack Kerouac's \"On the Road.\" Therefore, the book that inspired the band's name is \"On the Road\" by Jack Kerouac.\n\n**On the Road** by **Jack Kerouac**\n",

The later-released movie is \"The Game\", and the number we need is \"The Game\" 's year of release, 1997.\n2.  **Aardvark molars:** From the Aardvark Wikipedia page, adult aardvarks have a dental formula of 0.0.2-3.30.0.2.3, meaning they have 2 to 3 molars on each side of the upper jaw and 2 to 3 molars on each side of the lower jaw. So, an aardvark can have between 8 and 12 molars.  The \"sum of *all* the molars\" implies we should use the maximum number of molars, making the total 12.\n3.  **Adult teeth in a dog:** From the Puppy Teething Wikipedia page, adult dogs have 42 permanent teeth.\n4.  **Ratio:** The ratio of the sum of all the molars in an aardvark over the number of adult teeth in a dog is 12 / 42 = 2 / 7 = 0.2857142857142857\n5.  **Multiplication:** Finally, we multiply 1997 by the ratio 0.2857142857142857. 1997 * 0.2857142857142857 = 570.5714285714286\n\nTherefore, the final answer is **570.5714285714286**\n",

The group, led by Igor Dyatlov, was found dead with some bodies exhibiting unexplained injuries, including major skull damage, severe chest trauma, missing eyes, and a missing tongue. The official investigation concluded that a \"compelling natural force\" caused the deaths, but numerous theories have emerged, including avalanches, animal attacks, infrasound-induced panic, military involvement, and more. Russia reopened the investigation in 2019 and concluded in 2020 that an avalanche most likely forced the hikers to leave their camp suddenly in low-visibility conditions with inadequate clothing before dying of hypothermia.\n\nThe 2013 horror film *Devil's Pass* (originally titled *The Dyatlov Pass Incident*) is inspired by this event. The film follows a group of American college students who investigate the incident, using a found-footage style. In the film's plot, the students uncover a conspiracy involving government experiments, teleportation, mutants, and a wormhole. One theory is that a government experiment went wrong and created the events that took place at Dyatlov Pass.\n\nTherefore, the Dyatlov Pass incident was a real-life tragedy, and *Devil's Pass* uses it as a starting point for a fictional horror story involving secret experiments and paranormal elements.\n",

The movie follows a group of American college students who travel to the Dyatlov Pass to investigate the mystery. The film uses the found footage style and presents a fictional explanation involving government experiments, teleportation, and mutated creatures to account for the hikers' deaths, deviating significantly from the known facts and established theories surrounding the actual Dyatlov Pass incident. **The film uses the real incident as a jumping-off point for a fictional horror story.**\n",

      "answer": "Based on the scraped data:\n\n*   James Joyce: Born 2 February 1882, Died 13 January 1941\n*   Virginia Woolf: Born 25 January 1882, Died 28 March 1941\n\nBoth writers died in 1941. Now let's calculate their ages in days.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of days they lived:\n\n*   James Joyce: February 2, 1882 to January 13, 1941\n*   Virginia Woolf: January 25, 1882 to March 28, 1941\n\nSince directly calculating the number of days between these dates is beyond my capabilities, I will calculate the age in years and then approximate days.\n\n*   James Joyce: Died at 58 years old.\n*   Virginia Woolf: Died at 59 years old.\n\nVirginia Woolf lived longer. Now we need to calculate the difference in days.\n\n*   James Joyce was born on February 2, 1882 and died on January 13, 1941.\n*   Virginia Woolf was born on January 25, 1882 and died on March 28, 1941.\n\nTo find the exact difference, we can calculate the number of days from their birthdates to the end of 1882 and then the number of days from the beginning of 1941 to their death dates. Finally, we add the number of days in the intervening years.\n\n*   Days from February 2, 1882 to December 31, 1882: 365 - 32 (Jan) - 1 = 332 days (1882 was not a leap year).\n*   Days from January 1, 1941 to January 13, 1941: 13 days\n\n*   Days from January 25, 1882 to December 31, 1882: 365 - 24 = 341 days (1882 was not a leap year).\n*   Days from January 1, 1941 to March 28, 1941: 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 28 (Mar) = 87 days (1941 was not a leap year).\n\nNumber of years between 1883 and 1940 inclusive is 1940 - 1883 + 1 = 58 years.\nNumber of leap years between 1883 and 1940:\n1884, 1888, 1892, 1896, 1900, 1904, 1908, 1912, 1916, 1920, 1924, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1940. That's 15 leap years.\nNumber of non-leap years is 58 - 15 = 43 years.\n\nTotal days in those years is 43 * 365 + 15 * 366 = 15695 + 5490 = 21185 days.\n\nTotal days James Joyce lived = 332 + 13 + 21185 = 21530 days\nTotal days Virginia Woolf lived = 341 + 87 + 21185 = 21613 days\n\nDifference in days = 21613 - 21530 = 83 days\n\nTherefore, Virginia Woolf lived longer than James Joyce by 83 days.\n\nFinal Answer: The two modernist writers were James Joyce and Virginia Woolf.
